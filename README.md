# Loops in C++

## Aim
- To study and implement different types of loops in C++.
- To understand how loops help in executing repetitive tasks efficiently.

## Apparatus
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### Loops in C++
Loops are control structures that allow repeated execution of a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. They help reduce code redundancy and simplify repetition-based logic.

C++ provides the following types of loops:
- `for` loop: Used when the number of iterations is known.
- `while` loop: Used when the condition is checked before the loop body is executed.
- `do...while` loop: Executes the loop body at least once before checking the condition.

Loops are commonly used for tasks like iterating over a range of values, processing arrays, and running conditional logic repeatedly.

## Functions

- Use `for` loop for counting and range-based iterations.
- Implement `while` loop for condition-controlled repetition.
- Apply `do...while` loop when the loop body must run at least once.
- Understand loop control using `break` and `continue` statements.
- Practice using loops in practical scenarios such as summing numbers, printing patterns, or processing input.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how to use loops in C++ to repeat tasks based on conditions. I explored different types of loops including `for`, `while`, and `do...while`, and understood when to use each. This experiment helped me build efficient programs by reducing repetitive code and applying logical repetition patterns.
